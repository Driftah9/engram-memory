# Changelog

All notable changes to engram-memory will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-29

### Added

- Inline wiki-link relations: `[[node-name]]` references in a node body now become
  relation edges (merged with `see_also`, deduped, self-links dropped). Turns the
  index into a dense MOC/graph instead of relying on `see_also` frontmatter alone.
- `smart_recall(query, k=4)` (module-level `engram.smart_recall` and
  `MemoryStore.smart_recall`): natural-language-robust recall — stopword strip +
  keyword OR-match + best-matching section with exact line pointers. Use it when a
  full sentence would AND-match nothing under `query()`.

### Changed

- Decoupled the library from any install location: optional multi-user scoping now
  imports a plain `data_scope` module from the host app's path if present, instead of
  hard-coding `/home/claude` and `adapters.core`. The library makes no assumption
  about where it runs.
- Documentation examples use neutral sample queries.
